This is a practice project from [Learn to Code: HTML and CSS](learn.shayhowe.com) by Shay Howe.<br/>
This is just for personal practice only, to educate myself with basic web development.

<p> If you are trying to learn HTML and CSS or just brushing up on some basics, I highly recommend Shay Howe's website. It's easy to follow and doing the practice project is a really great way to follow along.<p>
